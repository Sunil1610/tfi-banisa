- Howler.js for sound effects

**For Minimal:**
- Pure CSS animations
- Minimal JavaScript
- Focus on performance

**For Retro:**
- CSS filters for grain effects
- Canvas for custom graphics
- Vintage-style SVG illustrations

### Responsive Strategy
All designs should follow:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Touch-friendly targets (min 44x44px)
